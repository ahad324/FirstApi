# Product Management API

## Overview

The Product Management API is a RESTful API built with Node.js and Express, designed to manage a collection of products. It allows users to perform CRUD operations on product data, including filtering, sorting, and pagination. The API is connected to a MongoDB database using Mongoose for data modeling.

## Features

- **Product Management**: Create, read, update, and delete products.
- **Filtering**: Filter products by company, name, and featured status.
- **Sorting**: Sort products based on various fields.
- **Pagination**: Retrieve products in a paginated format.
- **Environment Configuration**: Use environment variables for configuration.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- dotenv
- Nodemon (for development)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MongoDB (local or cloud instance)
- npm (Node package manager)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ahad324/FirstApi.git
   cd FirstApi
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:

   ```plaintext
   MONGODB_URI=<your-mongodb-uri>
   PORT=3000
   ```

   Replace `<your-mongodb-uri>` with your actual MongoDB connection string.

4. **Seed the database** (optional):

   If you want to populate the database with initial product data, run:

   ```bash
   node productDB.js
   ```

### Running the Application

To start the server, run:
```bash
npm start
```

For development mode with automatic restarts, use:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The server will be running on `http://localhost:3000`.
